\title{SeaView: DNA sequences and phylogenetic tree viewer}
\usage{
seaview(x, seaview_exec = options("bioseq.seaview.exec"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a DNA, RNA or AA vector.
Alternatively a \code{DNAbin} or \code{AAbin} object or
a phylogenetic tree (class \code{phylo}).}

\item{seaview_exec}{a character string giving the path of the program.}
}
\description{
This function opens SeaView (Gouy, Guindon & Gascuel, 2010)
to visualize biological sequences and phylogenetic trees.
The software must be installed on the computer.
}
\details{
By default, the function assumes that the executable is installed
in a directory located on the PATH. Alternatively the user can provide
an absolute path to the executable which can be stored in the global
options settings using
\code{options(bioseq.seaview.exec = "my_path_to_seaview")}.
